This program implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of times to form the ciphertext. To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift. The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system

Features

    Encryption: Encrypt plaintext messages by shifting each letter by a specified key value.
    Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext messages by shifting each letter back to its original position using the same key value.
    Key Input: Input a key value to determine the number of shifts for encryption or decryption.
    Clear Text: Clear the text area to enter new messages or reset the current input.

How to Use

    Open the provided HTML file (index.html) in a web browser.
    Enter the plaintext message or ciphertext message into the text area.
    Input the key value in the designated input field.
    Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the message.
    Optionally, click the "Clear" button to clear the text area and start over with a new message.
